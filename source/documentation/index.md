# Pillar 2 Roadmap

Version 1.0 issued TBC
***

## About this roadmap

This roadmap sets out the current release schedule for the Pillar 2 API. 

New features are released into the sandbox for testing, which means you can work with example API data to send requests and return responses. Once features are tested successfully, they are deployed to production to be accessed by API consumers. Release dates are subject to change in order to adapt to project requirements.
